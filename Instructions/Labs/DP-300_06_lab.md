**Lab files**: The files for this lab are in the D:\LabFiles\Automate Resources folder.

# Lab overview

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to configure and subsequently implement automate processes within AdventureWorks. 

# Lab objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Deploy an Azure resource from a GitHub Quickstart template

- Configure performance metric related notifications

- Deploy an Azure Automation Runbook to perform index maintenance in an Azure SQL Database

# Scenario

You have been hired as a Senior Data Engineer to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance as well as provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria. AdventureWorks utilizes SQL Server in both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service offerings.
